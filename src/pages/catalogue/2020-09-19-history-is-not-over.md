A report on poetry, protest, the actuality of action, and the delay of writing, with reference to the prose poem “The Strike” by Tillie Lerner (later Olsen), a text about the wildcat strike in the San Francisco harbor in 1934, important for the emergence of the North American Popular Front movement.
